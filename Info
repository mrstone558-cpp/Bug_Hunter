# wait / waitpid
Waits for a child process to finish execution and collects its exit status, preventing zombie processes.


#Macros of Waitpid
WIFEXITED(status) – checks if the child ended normally;
WEXITSTATUS(status) – gets child’s exit code;
WIFSIGNALED(status) – true if terminated by a signal;
WTERMSIG(status) – gets signal number that killed the process.


#How to Use:
Call waitpid(child_pid, &status, 0); then use macros to analyze status.


#fork()
Creates a new child process by duplicating the current process; returns 0 in the child and child PID in the parent.


#execvp()
Replaces the current process image with a new program, executing another binary within the same process space.
